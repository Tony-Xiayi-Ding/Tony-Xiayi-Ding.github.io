Despite concerns about the financial expenses of hospital readmission and the prevalence of diabetes, readmission among diabetes patients is not well studied. Moreover, previous studies have indicated that racial minorities and members of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to be readmitted. Consequently, this project aims to explore predictive models for the readmission of diabetic patients as well as to determine if there are any potential biases in the decision-making processes of these models.


## Models and their performances

### XGBoost


### Random Forest



## Additional Evaluations
