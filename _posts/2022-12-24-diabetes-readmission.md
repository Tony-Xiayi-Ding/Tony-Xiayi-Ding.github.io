Patients diagnosed with diabetes have to monitor and manage their blood sugar levels constantly for the rest of their lives; and if not well-monitored, individuals may be readmitted healthcare facilities due to complications. Despite concerns about the financial expenses of readmission and the prevalence of diabetes, readmission among diabetes patients is not well studied. Moreover, previous studies have indicated that racial minorities and members of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to be readmitted. This project aims to explore predictive models for the readmission of diabetic patients as well as to determine if there are any potential biases in the decision-making processes of these models.

## Results


Shapley values for the XGboost model trained on the original dataset:

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error
