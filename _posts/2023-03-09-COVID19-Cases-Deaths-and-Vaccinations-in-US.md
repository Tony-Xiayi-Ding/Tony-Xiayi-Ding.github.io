This interactive visualization uses a Python-based app framework called **streamlit** to demonstrate COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations data in US by states. This visualization also allows you to check out the geographical distribution and the temporal evolution of the case fatality rates and the total vaccinations per hundred people for various states at different time points. The data for this visualization were obtained from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-2021.csv) and [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/us_state_vaccinations.csv).
