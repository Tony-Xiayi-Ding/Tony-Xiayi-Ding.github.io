By cleaning a [cancer mortality dataset](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/bmi706-2022/blob/main/cancer_data/cancer_ICD10.csv) and merging it with a [population dataset](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/bmi706-2022/blob/main/cancer_data/population.csv), I created an interactive visualization using a Python-based app framework called **streamlit** to demonstrate the age-specific cancer mortality rates in different countries. This visualization also allows you to check out the mortality rates of various kinds of cancers for different countries, years, and genders. 

Click on the visualizaiton below to play with it!
