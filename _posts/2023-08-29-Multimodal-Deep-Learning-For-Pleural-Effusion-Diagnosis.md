**May. 25th UpdateðŸŽ‰:**
This interactive visualization won the **Bright Futures Award (2nd Place)** of the [2023 NNLM Data Visualization Contest](https://www.nnlm.gov/nec/resources/datavizchallenge) under the **Complex Visualization** category. [Here](https://news.nnlm.gov/nec/2023/05/30/nnlm-data-visualization-challenge-winners-announced/) is the official award announcement, and [here](https://zenodo.org/record/8021374) is our work summarized on Zenodo.

This interactive visualization uses a Python-based app framework called **streamlit** to demonstrate COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations data in US by states. This visualization also allows you to check out the geographical distribution and the temporal evolution of the case fatality rates and the total vaccinations per hundred people for various states at different time points. The data for this visualization were obtained from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-2021.csv) and [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/us_state_vaccinations.csv).
