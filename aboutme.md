### My story

I graduated from **Harvard University** in May 2024 with a Master of Science degree in **Health Data Science**. I was also cross-registered at the **MIT** Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from 2022-2024. 

I am currently working at CVS Health as a **Data Scientist** on several Gen-AI projects under the Unit Cost & Operations Analytics Team.
