### My story

This website is Tony Ding's Personal Website, where I will be showcasing some of the projects that I've done recently.

- Project 1: My BST-260 Final Project on All-NBA teams prediction (using R). 
  - I chose this project because I'm a huge fan of basketballüèÄ.


To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
