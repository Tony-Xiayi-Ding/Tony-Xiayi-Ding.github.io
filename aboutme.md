### My story

I am currently a first year Master's student at Harvard University Department of Biostatistics, and I am also cross registered at MIT EECS Department. You can reach me through ***xiayiding@hsph.harvard.edu*** or ***tding@mit.edu***.

This personal website is dedicated to showcase some of the projects that I've done recently. Here's a list of my projects that are on this website:

- Project 1: My BST-260 Final Project on All-NBA teams prediction (using R). 
  - I chose this project because I'm a huge fan of basketballüèÄ.
- Project 2: Diabetes Readmission Prediction (using Python)


I'm also listed on the official [Harvard webiste](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/masters-students/) if you would like to check it out.
