### My story

I am currently a first year Master's student at Harvard University Department of Biostatistics, and I am also cross registered at MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. You can reach me at **xiayiding@hsph.harvard.edu** and **tding@mit.edu**.

This personal website is dedicated to showcase some of the projects that I've done recently. Here's a list of my projects that are on this website:

- [Project 1](https://tony-xiayi-ding.github.io/BST260-Final-Project/): My BST-260 Final Project on All-NBA teams prediction (using R).

I'm also listed on the official [Harvard webiste](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/masters-students/) if you would like to check it out.
