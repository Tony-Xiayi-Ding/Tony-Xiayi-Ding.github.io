### My story

This is Tony Ding's personal website, where I will be showcasing some of the projects that I've done recently.

- Project 1: My BST-260 Final Project on All-NBA teams prediction (using R). 
  - I chose this project because I'm a huge fan of basketballüèÄ.
- Project 2: Diabetes Readmission Prediction (using Python)


I'm also listed on the official [Harvard webiste](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/masters-students/) if you would like to check it out.
